# What Designer Are You?
A question I continue to grapple with to this day!

This website was created for an introductory assignment for CSUMB's Graphic Identity course that encouraged us to explore and define what type of design we were interested in as a career.
For me, I wanted to express my identity as a web designer by creating short, one-page website to present with some of the recent libraries I was learning at the time instead of creating yet another slides presentation.
